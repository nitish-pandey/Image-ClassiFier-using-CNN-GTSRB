# Traffic signal Classifier 
## In this project , we are going to use the german traffic light dataset 

German Traffic Sign Recognition Dataset (GTSRB) is an image classification dataset. The images are photos of traffic signs. The images are classified into 43 classes. The training set contains 39209 labeled images and the test set contains 12630 images.

You can download this dataset with the following urls ::

 The classes and the respective signames of the dataset are as :

The single image of each of the 43 classess of the dataset is shown above respectively.


And The count of images of each classes in the training directory is as ::

### For this project , we are goin to use Google - Colaboratory ( Colaboratory, or “Colab” for short, is a product from Google Research. Colab allows anybody to write and execute arbitrary python code through the browser, and is especially well suited to machine learning, data analysis and education.)
